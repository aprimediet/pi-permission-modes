Claude-Code-style **permission modes** for the [pi coding agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent). Three modes, cycled with **Shift+Tab**, that control how tool calls and file edits get approved. v1.1.1 adds **per-mode model profiles**. v1.1.3 adds **outside-cwd write tracking** with `/undo-outside-writes`. — when you switch modes, the model can switch with you.

## Modes

| Mode | edit / write | reads outside cwd | bash | agent control |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ask** `●` | prompt on each edit/write (`Allow` / `Allow all → auto` / `Block`) | **prompt** | mutating commands prompt; read-only pass | — |
| **plan** `⏸` | disabled (stripped from the active tool set) | allowed (exploration needed for planning) | read-only allowlist only; mutating commands blocked | produce a numbered `Plan:`, then **Execute / Stay / Refine** |
| **auto** `▶` | auto-approved (outside cwd tracked for undo via `/undo-outside-writes`) | auto-approved | auto-approved; prompts if destructive **outside** project root | auto-continues until done, bounded by `/auto-depth` |

**Cycle (Shift+Tab):** ask → plan → auto → ask.

When there is no interactive UI (`pi -p`, `--mode json`), anything that would prompt is **blocked** instead of silently allowed.

## Model profiles (v1.1.1)

Define named profiles in `~/.pi/agent/model-profiles.json` mapping each mode to a model ID:

```json
{
  "active": "default",
  "default": {
    "ask":  "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
    "plan": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
    "auto": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5"
  },
  "fast": {
    "ask":  "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
    "plan": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
    "auto": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5"
  }
}
```

A model ID is `"provider/model"` or `"provider/model:thinking"` (the `:thinking` suffix sets the thinking level after the switch — e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5:high`). When the mode changes, the extension auto-switches the model via `pi.setModel()`. The footer shows `profile:<name> · model/thinking` when a profile is active.

If the file doesn't exist on first install, the extension creates it for you (pre-filled with the user's default model from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` when available).

**Why a separate `model-profiles.json` and not pi's built-in `models.json`?** Pi uses `~/.pi/agent/models.json` for custom provider definitions; using a different filename avoids format conflict.

## Commands, shortcut, flag

| Kind | Name | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Command | `/ask`, `/plan`, `/auto` | switch to that mode (`/default` also works as alias) |
| Command | `/mode [name]` | set the given mode, or pick from a list |
| Command | `/auto-depth <n>` | cap auto-mode follow-ups (`0` = unlimited; default 20) |
| Command | `/model-profile` | show selector of available profiles |
| Command | `/model-profile <name>` | activate the named profile (also `/model-profile list` to print them) |
| Shortcut | `Shift+Tab` | cycle modes |
| Shortcut | `Alt+T` | cycle thinking level (off → minimal → low → medium → high → xhigh) |
| Shortcut | `Alt+I` | cycle model profile (next profile from `~/.pi/agent/model-profiles.json`; re-applies the model for the current mode) |
| Command | `/outside-writes` | list tracked outside-cwd writes (read-only) |
| Command | `/undo-outside-writes` | restore outside-cwd writes (selector, `all`, or `--list`) |
| Flag | `--permission-mode <name>` | start in a mode (accepts `ask`, `plan`, `auto`, or `default` as alias; default `ask`) |
| Flag | `--model-profile <name>` | start with a named profile activated |

> The start-mode flag is `--permission-mode` (not `--mode`) because pi already has a built-in `--mode` for output format (text/json/rpc).

### Outside-cwd write tracking (v1.1.3)

In **auto mode**, `edit` and `write` calls to paths outside the working directory are auto-approved — but each one is snapshotted to `<cwd>/.pi/projects/<project-id>/tmp/outside-writes/`. Use `/undo-outside-writes` to roll back:

- `/undo-outside-writes` — interactive selector (newest first)
- `/undo-outside-writes all` — restore all without prompting
- `/undo-outside-writes --list` — list only (alias for `/outside-writes`)
- `/outside-writes` — same as `--list`

Snapshots capture the file's pre-write content (or `null` if the file didn't exist). They persist across sessions until you undo them. The snapshot cap is 100 entries (oldest are evicted; you get a notification).

### Plan mode flow

In plan mode the agent explores read-only and emits a numbered list under a `Plan:` header. On completion you choose:

- **Execute the plan** — switches to auto, restores edit/write, runs the steps; a `☐/☑` widget advances as the agent emits `[DONE:n]` tags, and you get **Plan Complete! ✓** at the end.
- **Stay in plan mode** — keep iterating.
- **Refine the plan** — opens an editor; your notes are sent back as a follow-up.

## UI

- A status pill and a custom footer showing **mode · cwd [git-branch] · provider/model** (or **profile:name · provider/model** when a profile is active).
- While the agent is streaming, the working indicator shows live **token / tok-s / cost / % context** stats; it reverts to the default loader when idle.

Current mode, the auto-follow-up depth, and the active profile name **persist** across `/reload` and session resume.

## Install / run

```bash
# Install as a package (scoped npm name; or from a git remote / local path)
pi install npm:@aprimediet/permission-modes
pi list                                            # verify it loaded

# Or run it directly for a quick try (no install)
pi -e ./extensions/permission-modes/index.ts

# During development, hot-reload after edits
/reload
```

Auto-discovery also works: drop this folder at `~/.pi/agent/extensions/permission-modes/` (global) or `.pi/extensions/permission-modes/` (project) and pi loads `index.ts` automatically.

## Testing

```bash
npm test                # run all 144+ tests (vitest)
npm run test:watch      # watch mode for development
```

Third-party deps: none. Peer dependencies (bundled by pi): `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, `@earendil-works/pi-ai`, `@earendil-works/pi-tui`, `typebox`. The model is switched **only when the user opts in via `~/.pi/agent/model-profiles.json`** — without a profile config file, the model never changes and the extension behaves exactly as in v1.1.0.
